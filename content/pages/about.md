## Computers and other things to tinker with

As a small kid I'd love to tinker with stuff.
Getting a screwdriver stuck somewhere was a great feeling, even when it was a active outlet.

Disassembling things just to put them back together was a great joy.
With the time the experience grow and less screws were left over moving on to actually fixing things.

Things without screws and bolts are also quite interesting: Getting access to a PC opened up new possibilities disassembling and reassembling things.
I guess this is one of the things I like the most about open source software: If you really want you can deep dive until your curiosity is fed up.

Born in the nineties there was this new thing called internet.
Oh boy, what a wild time!

Since then I have been able to gather professional experience in various things and technologies: Setting up and hosting mail servers, building continental site-to-site-VPNs, web applications, various APIs, virtualisation, data storage and replication, infrastructure, various cloud offerings, edge computing, supporting ancient and long-running systems, etc.

Sometimes there is a pcap file that has the answer, most of the times it DNS, other times it's YAML.
Sources of bugs, quirks and other fun things can be hiding everywhere.

And I like wrenching on things.
Most of the time with success.
