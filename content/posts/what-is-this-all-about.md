## What is this all about?

A few decades back, yes, it seems I'm getting old, I've started writing some HTML in a text editor and was happy how a webbrowser rendered all this stuff to something visual more appealing something.

Now the time has come to let the world know what I'd like to let it know.
Instead of writing pure HTML I got a lot more on the tool belt since then, but I'll stuck with Markdown that is rendered by Hugo.
Is somewhat more comfortable then back in the days, sometimes things evolve to the better, I guess.

I've stopped blogging or publishing things in the internet with joining various social networks.
Now I quitted most of them and I feel like this sort of publication is a little bit more personal, as well as more sustainable.
And much easier to follow or ignore.
There are still a couple of forum posts I stumble across from time to time searching for a thing in front of me.
It's nice to see those sources are still up, but some are already shut down and not accessible anymore others are locking things up in a walled garden.

Let's see how often and which kind of topics we'll find here.
